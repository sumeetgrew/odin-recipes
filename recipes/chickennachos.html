        <h1>Chicken Nachos</h1>
        <img src="./images/chickennachos.jpg" style="height:500px;width:auto;">
        <p>Tortilla chips are topped with a chicken and salsa mixture, melted 
            cheese and tomato. These hearty nachos make a great snack and 
            work well as a meal, too!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortilla chips, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican-style cheese blend</li>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) can diced green chilies, drained</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the chicken, vegetable oil, 
                and cayenne pepper. Let stand for 15 minutes, or longer if 
                desired.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken 
                mixture, and fry until chicken is no longer pink. Remove 
                from heat, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread 
                a thin layer of tortilla chips in a 9x13 inch baking dish. 
                Sprinkle 1/4 of the chicken, 1/4 of the chilies, and 1/4 of 
                the cheese over the chips. Repeat layers ending with cheese 
                on the top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the 
                cheese is melted and everything is heated through. Serve with 
                your favorite nacho toppings.</li>
        </ol>
