    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato-based hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vinegar-based hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor or indoor grill to a high heat. 
            Lightly grease the grill.</li>
        <li>Season wings with garlic powder and ground black 
            pepper. Cook wings on the preheated grill until 
            they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as 
            they will burn easily.</li>
        <li>While the wings are grilling, in a large bowl, combine 
            both hot sauces with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and 
            melted butter.</li>
        <li>When the wings are finished cooking, place them in the 
            large bowl of hot sauce mixture and stir until they are 
            coated.</li>
    </ol>
