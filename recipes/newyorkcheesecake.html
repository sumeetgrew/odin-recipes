    <h1>New York Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="./images/newyorkcheesecake.jpg" style="width:500px;height:auto;">
    <p>This recipe makes a classic New York-style cheesecake with a 
        buttery graham cracker crust and rich, dense filling made from 
        cream cheese, eggs, sugar, sour cream, vanilla, a hint of lemon, 
        and a few tablespoons of flour. The flour might seem like an 
        unusual addition, but it’s the secret to success: a little 
        starch helps prevent the cake from cracking and also makes 
        the filling just a bit lighter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>15 graham crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
            (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch 
            springform pan.</li>
        <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter 
            together in a medium bowl until well combined; 
            press onto the bottom of the prepared pan to make 
            a packed crust.</li>
        <li>Mix cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl 
            until smooth. Blend in milk, then mix in eggs, one 
            at a time, until just combined. Add sour cream, flour, 
            and vanilla; mix until smooth. Pour filling onto 
            prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off; 
            let cheesecake cool in the oven with the door closed 
            for 5 to 6 hours to prevent cracking.</li>
        <li>Chill in the refrigerator until serving.</li>
    </ol>
